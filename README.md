A console-based Library Management System built in C++, designed to demonstrate the four core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
principles
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
along with adherence to SOLID design principles.
The project provides a simple yet well-structured example of how OOP and clean design architecture can be applied to real-world
problems.

## Building

Use a single g++ command to compile all sources in `src/`:

```
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic src/*.cpp -o library
```

Run the program with:

```
./library
```
